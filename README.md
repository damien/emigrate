# Emigrate

Emigrate is a framework for mapping arbitrary data structures from one format
to another.

## Project Goals

  0. Provide a simple, testable way to model data transformations
  0. Provide a common work-flow for chaining together data transoformations
  0. Explore methods for verifying integrity of transoformed data (i.e.
     check for missing datum, identify edge cases during data transoformation,
     create deterministic data transformations)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'emigrate'

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:
